As controls, both a normal lymphoblast cell line derived from the unaffected carrier mother as well as two other normal lymphoblast cell lines were used (7).
In the five control cell lines, which include a normal lymphoblast cell line, a HeLa cell line, and three cell lines derived from XPA, XPB, and XPC patients, we found no sequence changes in hRAD30.
Hitherto, our knowledge of the genetics of gene expression in humans has derived mostly from studies of blood (5), lymphoblast cell lines (6), and isolated studies of accessible tissues such as fat or skin (7).
We have also demonstrated by amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of reverse-transcribed mRNA (RT PCR) that the mutant allele is transcribed in the lymphoblast cell line of an affected individual from the Italian kindred (Fig.3) (8).
Cultured human lymphoblast cell lines homozygous for the l allele have higher concentrations of 5-HTT mRNA and express nearly twofold greater 5-HT reuptake compared with cells possessing either one or two copies of the s allele, which may act dominantly (2).
Activation of endogenous ATM was examined in two different normal lymphoblast cell lines exposed to 0 or 5 Gy IR (19).
It also recognized TRPM4 in mouse thymocytes, in the mouse Th2 cell clone, D10.G4, and in the two human T lymphoblast cell lines, Molt-4 and Jurkat (Fig. 2B), suggesting that TRPM4 is a conserved and an important ion channel for lymphocytes across multiple species.
The authors applied PRIME to Recon1 using data from 224 lymphoblast cell lines and the NCI-60 cell lines to reconstruct individual models for each cell line, and demonstrated that the models could accurately predict proliferation rates and responses to a collection of metabolic drugs.
For example,  studied the ROS generation, SOD activity and MDA levels of a lymphoblast cell line exposed to two bentonites, an unmodified or native bentonite (BPN) and a modified or active bentonite (BPA) activated with H2SO4.
Much of what we know about the mitochondrial pathophysiology in Barth patients comes from studies of human fibroblasts and immortalized lymphoblast cell lines.
Moreover, DOX-conjugated PLLA-b-mPEG micelles exerted more potent cytotoxicity against cancer cells (human lymphoblast cell line, HSB-2) than free DOX in vitro, suggesting that they were more easily taken up by cells via an endocytosis process (free Dox entered cells by passive diffusion) with concomitant rapid release of cleaved DOX into the cytoplasm from acidic endosomes .
WS lymphoblast cell lines carrying homozygous mutations in the WRN gene were found to be reduced to 40\u201360% of the transcription observed in normal cells using a [3H]-uridine incorporation assay with permeabilized cells or an in vitro assay with nuclear extracts and a plasmid template bearing a RNA polymerase II-specific promoter (Balajee et al., 1999).
Further analysis to determine safety found that this analogue demonstrated no cytotoxicity up to 100\u202f\u03bcM against numerous cell lines including the human hepatocyte cell lines Huh7 and HepG2, the human pancreatic cell line BxBC3, and the human T-lymphoblast cell line CEM .
Furthermore, rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG was correlated with higher levels of LGALS1 mRNA and protein expression in lymphoblast cell lines .
Furthermore, recent RNA sequencing studies using lymphoblast cell lines revealed that not only p48 and p52 transcripts but also p42 and p44a transcripts are expressed when the A allele is present . The short exon 3 using the alternative splice acceptor site within the exon 3 (p23 transcript) reported in lymphoblast cell lines  was not observed in our study. Laronde et al. reported that the p42 transcript accounted for 5% of the total OAS1 transcripts in a lymphoblast cell line with a GG genotype, as determined by RNA sequencing ; this was in accord with the results obtained from our absolute quantification method.
Previously,  investigated the expression patterns of several cytokine in cloned T. parva-infected lymphoblast cell lines, and showed that only IL10 was universally expressed.
A549, a human lung alveolar type II epithelial carcinoma cell line, BEAS-2B, a human lung bronchiolar epithelial cell line, HFL-1 and MRC-5, human embryonic lung fibroblast cell lines, and Jurkat, a human leukemic T cell lymphoblast cell line, were all obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD).
Two different rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) formulations are usually employed in conditioning regimens in China: thymocyte r-ATG and T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG. To the best of our knowledge, no large-scale studies have been reported that compare the outcomes of thymocyte r-ATG and T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG in allo-HSCT in patients with SAA. Patients with a matched sibling donor were treated with thymocyte r-AT (2.5 mg/kg/d) or T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG (5 mg/kg/d) i.v. on days \u22128 to \u22124. Patients with haploidentical donors were treated with thymocyte r-ATG (2.5 mg/kg/d) or T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG (5 mg/kg/d) i.v. on days \u22125 to \u22122. Of the initially enrolled 214 patients, 25 and 189 patients were enrolled in the T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG group and thymocyte r-ATG group, respectively. We selected 23 and 44 patients in the T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG group and thymocyte r-ATG group after PSM, respectively. The median year of transplant for the thymocyte r-ATG and T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG patients is 27 and 26 years, respectively. The absolute mononuclear cell counts were 10.74 (3.61 to 24.50)\u202f\u00d7\u202f108/kg and 13.17 (3.57 to 24.00)\u202f\u00d7\u202f108/kg (P\u202f=\u202f.022), and the CD34+ cells counts were 3.90 (1.02 to 9.38)\u202f\u00d7\u202f106/kg and 4.00 (2.00 to 5.95)\u202f\u00d7\u202f106/kg (P\u202f=\u202f.885) between the thymocyte r-ATG and T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG groups. The median time to platelet engraftment in the T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG group was longer: 11 (10 to 50) versus 13 (10 to 41) days, P\u202f=\u202f.030. The T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG group showed a significantly higher incidence of grade III to IV acute GVHD (17.39% versus 2.27%, P\u202f=\u202f.026). No significant differences were observed with respect to myeloid engraftment (11 [8 to 17] versus 11 [9 to 14] days, P\u202f=\u202f.306), grade II to IV acute GVHD (20.46% versus 21.74%, P\u202f=\u202f.948), chronic GVHD (26.83% versus 22.73%, P\u202f=\u202f.704), and moderate to severe chronic GVHD (9.76% versus 13.64%, P\u202f=\u202f.648) between the thymocyte r-ATG and T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG groups. The rate of infections was 59.09% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44.00% to 74.20%) in the thymocyte r-ATG group and 56.52% (95% CI, 34.60% to 74.20%) in the T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG group (P\u202f=\u202f.840). Three (6.82%) patients in the thymocyte r-ATG group and 0 patients in the T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG group experienced early mortality (P\u202f=\u202f.510); 5 (11.36%) patients in the thymocyte r-ATG group and 1 (4.35%) patient in the T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG group experienced transplantation-related mortality (P\u202f=\u202f.614). In the thymocyte r-ATG group, the causes of death included infection (n\u202f=\u202f1), GVHD (n\u202f=\u202f2), bleeding (n\u202f=\u202f1), graft failure (n\u202f=\u202f1), and myelodysplastic syndrome (n\u202f=\u202f1); in the T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG group, the cause of death included GVHD (n\u202f=\u202f1) (P > .05). The 5-year OS was 86.40% \u00b1 5.20% in the thymocyte r-ATG group and 95.70% \u00b1 4.30% in the T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG (P\u202f=\u202f.245); the 5-year GFFS was 77.30% \u00b1 6.30% in the thymocyte r-ATG group and 78.30% \u00b1 8.60% in the T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG (P\u202f=\u202f.986). Thymocyte r-ATG has a very broad antibody spectrum against T cells at all stages of maturation, and T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG results in a more specific antibody spectrum against activated T cells . Thymocyte r-ATG and T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG show variable antibody specificities and exert different immunomodulatory effects . This study included the largest series of patients with SAA treated with allo-HSCT published to date to compare thymocyte r-ATG and T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG. Although patients in the T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG group showed higher absolute mononuclear cell counts (P\u202f=\u202f.022), platelet engraftment was slower (P\u202f=\u202f.030). The incidence of grade III to IV acute GVHD was also higher in the T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG group, possibly because thymocyte r-ATG has a stronger immunosuppressive activity than T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG . However, there are no relevant reports of conditioning regimens combined with thymocyte r-ATG and T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG in allo-HSCT in patients with SAA. Because the number of patients enrolled was low in the T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG group, a well-designed, prospective, randomized, and multicenter cooperative study will be required to confirm the efficacy of thymocyte r-ATG compared with T lymphoblast cell line r-ATG in the treatment of patients with SAA with allo-HSCT.
An immortalized but non-tumorigenic human B lymphoblast cell line, HMy2.CIR, was obtained from Shanghai Cell Bank (Shanghai, China) and cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM; HyClone, Beijing, China) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM
The model system we chose to study was the human lymphoblast cell line WTK1. The human B lymphoblast cell line WTK1 was derived from the WI-L2 cell line [11].
Besides, it was also analyzed in human TK6 lymphoblast cell line at two gene loci (tk\n\n+/\u2212\n\nand hprt\n\n+\n). However, to generate further confidence among consumers mutagenic potential of irradiated SBF was determined in different model systems including human lymphoblast cell line (at two gene loci). The induced mutation in human lymphoblast cell line at two gene loci (tk\n+/\u2212 and hprt\n+) was found to be negligible even upon S9 activation which ruled out the possibility of the formation of any mutagens in irradiated SBF, whereas positive controls EMS and 5-AZ were found to increase the relative number of mutants in both tk\n+/\u2212 and hprt\n+ gene loci by 20 and 22 fold, respectively. At further higher concentration, cell viability in human lymphoblast cell line was the concern mostly due to disturbance in homeostasis. The TK6 human lymphoblast cell line contains two widely used selectable markers: the heterozygous tk locus on chromosome 17q and the X-linked, hemizygous hprt locus. The product did not induce any mutagenesis when assessed in various models including human lymphoblast cell line and thus ensured its genotoxic safety.

The gene probes selected for gene validation in human fibroblast cells (see Fig. 3) were used to analyze changes in transcript levels in the human lymphoblast cell line GM02259.
RT-PCR experiments with transformed lymphoblast cell lines from one of the patients and her parent confirmed that this mutation disrupted normal splicing of JAM3.
In the TK6 gene mutation assay, the autosomal (17q) and heterozygous nature of thymidine kinase (tk\n+/-) gene in TK6 lymphoblast cell line, allows the detection of cells deficient in thymidine kinase enzyme following mutation to tk\n-\n/- upon mutagen exposure ,. Cytotoxicity to TK6 human lymphoblast cell line was not observed up to 2.5\u00a0mM concentrations of ESP (Fig. 1 Similar results were also obtained with TK6 human lymphoblast cell line, where ~53 and 67% reduction in mutation frequency was observed due to 0.5 and 1\u00a0mM concentrations of ESP, respectively (Fig. 2B).
In addition to antibacterial activity, this member of class IIa exhibits the great anticancer activity against several cancer cell lines as well as gastrointestinal cancer, such as the mouse spleen lymphoblast cell line (Sp2/O-Ag14) hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) . Evidence suggests that fermenticin HV6b has a cytotoxic effect on different cancerous cell lines as well as Sp2/0-Ag14 that is a spleen lymphoblast cell line .
To generate this iPSC line, the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-immortalized lymphoblast cell line \u2013 Lymph3  derived from a 74-year-old male AD patient (age at onset 74) was used. Briefly, the lymphoblast cell line Lymph3 was reprogrammed employing oriP/EBNA-1-based episomal plasmids expressing OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, LIN28, L-MYC and a p53 shRNA. The lymphoblast cell line Lymph3  was cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), 1% Glutamax (Invitrogen), 1% Sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen) at 37\u202f\u00b0C and 5% CO2.
To generate this iPSC line, the lymphoblast cell line - Lymph1  derived from a 67-year-old male AD patient (age at onset 65) was used. Briefly, the lymphoblast cell line Lymph1 was reprogrammed employing oriP/EBNA-1-based episomal plasmids expressing OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, C-MYC, L-MYC, LIN28 and a p53 shRNA. The lymphoblast cell line Lymph1  was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen\u2122), 1% Glutamax (Invitrogen\u2122), 1% Sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen\u2122) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen\u2122) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.
The chicken macrophage cell line HD11 , the reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV)-transformed chicken lymphoblast cell lines CU205 and CU91 , and splenic lymphocytes obtained from 3-week-old chickens were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) (Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 unit/ml) (Hyclone) at 41 \u00b0C in 5% CO2.
To evaluate the effects of MG132 and CSP on lentiviral transduction, we first performed a 1-day transduction of a human lymphoblast cell line (CEMx174) with GFP-expressing \u03c7HIV or HIV1 vectors in media containing various concentrations (0.1\u20131.0 \u03bcmol/L) of MG132 or CSP at MOI of 1 (Fig.\u00a01B). In addition, when there was no drug treatment, the \u03c7HIV vector showed lower %GFP in the human lymphoblast cell line compared with the HIV1 vector (p < 0.01). In this study, our \u03c7HIV vector (containing SIV capsid) demonstrated similar transduction efficiency (evaluated by %GFP) in human CD34+ cells in\u00a0vitro (Figs. 2A and 5) and in humanized xenograft mouse transplantation (Fig.\u00a06B) as compared with the HIV1 vector overall, whereas the \u03c7HIV vector produced lower transduction efficiency in the human lymphoblast cell line.
A lymphoblast cell line (RPMI 1788) was obtained from the ATCC and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (J R Scientific, USA), and 1% sodium pyruvate (Gibco, China).
A human control lymphoblast cell line was exposed to medium containing either 5 \u03bcmol/L or 50 \u03bcmol/L Hcy for 4 passages. The precision of the method was determined by obtaining intra- (n\n = 5) and inter-assay (n\n = 8) variation for a control fibroblast cell line and a control lymphoblast cell line. Intra- and inter-assay CVs for a control lymphoblast cell line were <6.0% and 19.3%, respectively over the time period of 2 years. Exposure of a control lymphoblast cell line to 5 \u03bcmol/L of Hcy in the medium for 4 passages increased the CBS activity from 2.9 to 10.6 nmol/h \u00d7 mg protein.
The murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell line (CRL-1642), human lung carcinoma cell lines H1299 (CCL-5803) and A549 (CCL-185), and human lymphoblast cell line Jurkat (TIB-152) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The H1299 human lung carcinoma cell line, and Jurkat human lymphoblast cell line were cultured with RPMI1640.
The lymphoblast cell line CON9  was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen\u2122), 1% Glutamax (Invitrogen\u2122), 1% Sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen\u2122) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen\u2122) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Genomic DNA was isolated from the lymphoblast cell line Lymph9, the derived ISRM-CON9-iPSC line, and the human embryonic stem cell line (H1) using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen).
Human B-lymphoma cell lines Raji, Nalmawa, and human lymphoblast cell line HMY2-CIR were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Among them, malignant B-lymphoma cells Raji and Namalva were the most sensitive to oroxin B with IC50 values of 11.13 and 17.66 \u03bcM, respectively, while the non-tumorigenic human B-lymphoblast cell line HMY2-CIR was less vulnerable to oroxin B, with an IC50 value of 260.27 \u03bcM (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that malignant lymphoma cells were much more sensitive to oroxin B compared to the non-tumorigenic human B-lymphoblast cells. By contrast, when the non-tumorigenic human lymphoblast cell line HMY2-CIR was incubated with oroxin B at the same doses, cell morphology was not obviously changed (Fig.\u00a01C, low panel). Interestingly, oroxin B did not promote DDIT3 expression in both the non-tumorigenic B-lymphoblast cell line HMy2.CIR (Fig.\u00a04E) and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Fig.\u00a04F), consistent with the selective induction of a tumor suppressive ER stress and inhibition of the lymphoma growth as mentioned above (Figs.\u00a01 and 2). The Annexin V and PI binding assay showed that oroxin B did not obviously induce Raji cell apoptosis at doses of 5, 10, and 20 \u03bcM, but it significantly induced lymphoma cell apoptosis at doses of 30 and 40 \u03bcM (Supplementary Fig. S6A and B); by contrast, oroxin B at the same doses did not obviously induce apoptosis of the non-tumorigenic lymphoblast cell line HMy2.CIR (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B).
EBV-latent infected human Burkitt lymphomas Raji, and EBV-transformed marmosets B lymphoblast cell line B95\u22128 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA).
While the p.L114Del mutant lymphoblast cell line showed increased sensitivity to these agents, the p.R557X mutant, although failing to express senataxin, was as sensitive as control cells . Total extracts prepared from a control (ctr), and patient\u2019s lymphoblast cell lines were run on 6% and 10% SDS\u2013polyacrilamide gels. \nSETX large intragenic heterozygous deletions were excluded by sequencing the SETX transcript in the patient\u2019s lymphoblast cell line. We then checked senataxin expression by western blot with total protein extracts from the patient\u2019s (Pt) lymphoblast cell line.
TK6 was established from a diploid human lymphoblast cell line, WI-L2 ,.
The MOLT-4\u202fcells, a human T lymphoblast cell line, were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS at 37\u202f\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% (v/v) of CO2. The cytotoxicity of the crude LR extracts against MOLT-4\u202fcells, a human T lymphoblast cell line, was performed using the MTS assay.
Donn et al. showed that this SNP regulates promoter activity and is associated with higher reporter gene, luciferase activity in a human T lymphoblast cell line (CEMC7A) .
Overlapping reverse transcriptase\u2013PCR (RT-PCR) products representing these RNAs were prepared from a control lymphoblast cell line and from a lymphoblast cell line generated from an individual homozygous for the major FD haplotype. The same primers generated both the 218- and 144-bp products from RNA isolated from lymphoblast cell lines derived from individuals heterozygous for the major FD haplotype (fig. 1a
Immunophenotyping of donor's peripheral mononuclear cells and human's B-lymphoblast cell line IM9 for the estimation of CD19 marker expression on cell surface revealed 4.62% and 95.02%, respectively. In the Fig. 11 we represent dynamic changes of ZnO-NRs photoluminescence after the incubation of human B-lymphoblast cell line IM9 pre-modified with anti-CD19-FITC* and anti-IgG1-FITC* on the surface of ZnO-NRs.
The parent compound N\n1-phenyl-N\n7-phenylheptanediamide (termed 5b in  is a poor HDAC inhibitor (IC50 \u223c200 \u03bcM) and also fails to activate FXN gene expression in the FRDA lymphoblast cell line . Since 106 and 3 are both slow-on/slow-off inhibitors, we asked whether HDACi 3 would cause prolonged acetylation of endogenous histones in the FRDA lymphoblast cell line, as we have previously documented for 106 . At concentrations ranging up to 10 \u03bcM, the Sirt1 inhibitor had no effect on FXN mRNA levels in FRDA patient lymphocytes (Figure\u00a06C) or in either the FRDA lymphoblast cell line or patient fibroblasts (data not shown), although this compound has been shown to be cell permeable, and to function as a Sirt1 inhibitor in several cell lines . Histone H3 acetylation in the FRDA lymphoblast cell line persists for many hours after removal of 106 from the culture medium. The human Friedreich's ataxia lymphoblast cell line GM15850 (Coriell Institute, New Jersey) was grown in RPMI medium 1640 containing 10% FBS, 1% HEPES, and 1% PMSF.
To gain further insight into the mechanism by which methylproamine acts in human cells, we investigated the effect of methylproamine on the formation of \u03b3H2AX in human lymphoblast cell lines. Briefly, log phase lymphoblast cell lines were exposed to 3H-thymidine (1 mCi/ml) and then cells were allowed to grow for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C. Induction of apoptosis in lymphoblast cell lines following exposure to various concentrations of methylproamine or combinations of methylproamine pre-treatment and \u03b3-irradiation were examined by measuring the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-7, using a method based on fluorescence. We tested several different lymphoblast cell lines, including a cell line that had a defective DNA repair gene, DNA ligase IV, critical for the ligation step of the non-homologous DNA dsb end-joining pathway . We found that lymphoblast cell lines that were treated with methylproamine 15 min prior to all doses of IR showed a decreased fraction of DNA released into the gel 1 h after IR (Fig. 3 Caspase-3 and caspase-7 assays also indicate that methylproamine protects lymphoblast cell lines from radiation-induced apoptosis. In this study, we have shown that radiation-induced \u03b3H2AX foci number is decreased in patient-derived lymphoblast cell lines that have been pre-incubated with methylproamine.
To generate a fosmid library, genomic DNA was extracted from the lymphoblast cell line (KCB 99002) of a male Yunnan white-cheeked gibbon with size fractionized by field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE), and then was ligated with the fosmid vector pCC1FOS. The lymphoblast cell line (KCB 99002) of a male Yunnan white-cheeked gibbon with a normal karyotype (2n=52) was obtained from Kunming Cell Bank. The lymphoblast cell line of the white-cheeked gibbon was immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus and grown at 37\u00b0C in RPMI 1640 medium enriched with 15% newborn bovine serum.
A mouse Friend leukaemic lymphoblast cell line (clone 707) (ECACC, Cat. In order to investigate that possibility, a murine Friend leukaemic lymphoblast cell line (clone 707) was employed as a representative target population and cells were sensitised by exposure to electric fields as described above.
Ensuring the best balance between biochemical assay and cellular potency (B lymphoblast cell line; MM.1S), kinase selectivity, and a good PK profile, the optimized analog GDC-0339 was identified as a novel oral Pim kinase clinical candidate with potential anticancer activity that could be further investigated for use against multiple myeloma (Fig. 2e).
Human lymphoblast cell line MV-4-11 was maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Human lymphoblast cell line MOLT-4 were maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10\u00a0mM HEPES, 1\u00a0mM sodium pyruvate, 5\u00a0g/L glucose.
Experimental mutational signatures associated with the mutagenic effects of cisplatin and cyclophosphamide but also with endogenous DNA repair defects and homologous recombination deficiency mechanisms in combination with drug sensitivity testing were effectively modeled in clones generated from the isogenic chicken DT40 lymphoblast cell line harboring a stable diploid genome .
The leaf and root extracts of M. arvensis have been shown to elicit a protection effect against H2O2-induced genotoxicity in human lymphoblast cell line and several phytochemicals have been identified from the aerial parts of M. arvensis .
The IgA lymphoblast cell line DAKIKI (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and the B lymphoblast cell line Raji were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. For the m\u03b11(456S) allele, 293T and Raji transfectants both produced the long and short isoforms and DAKIKI cells, a human B-lymphoblast cell line expressing the m\u03b11(456S) allele, also expressed both isoforms (Fig. 4B).
In a previous paper (Buc et al., 1993), we have described in the human T lymphoblast cell line Jurkat, stimulated through CD3, a protein tyrosine kinase-dependent enhancement of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation and showed that this adenylyl cyclase potentiation by T cell stimulation directly involved adenylyl cyclase itself. In a first series of experiments, we checked that in PBMC, like in the human T lymphoblast cell line Jurkat (Buc et al., 1996), St potentiated the cAMP accumulation induced by different adenylyl cyclase agonists: PGE2, isoproterenol, 2-chloroadenosine, NECA, and that the highest enhancing effect was obtained with PGE2 as the agonist. Indeed, we used the latter property to demonstrate that the CD3-mediated activation of the human lymphoblast cell line Jurkat enhances the forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation through the intervention of protein tyrosine kinase activity (Buc et al., 1993).

CTSE was later found to have another function in modulating immune cells, as it was the major aspartic protease involved in antigen processing via the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) pathway in a B cell lymphoblast cell line .
In contrast with our examination of multiple FD lymphoblast cell lines that showed normal IKBKAP mRNA, Anderson et al.\n[9\u2022\u2022] reported a single FD lymphoblast line in which they observed an abnormal IKBKAP mRNA, which led them to identify the same mutation. As we observed no apparent consequence of the major FD mutation in lymphoblast cell line RNA, we extracted brain stem and temporal lobe RNA from a FD post-mortem brain sample and examined the region of IKBKAP near the intronic mutation. Subsequent intensive analysis of FD lymphoblast cell lines, which all express wild-type mRNA, demonstrated that the mutant mRNA could sometimes be detected at low levels. The apparent absence of wild-type IKBKAP mRNA in the single FD lymphoblast cell line shown by Anderson et al.\n[9\u2022\u2022] is at odds with these findings and the difference remains unexplained.
To test this hypothesis, we obtained Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)\u2013transformed lymphoblast cell lines DK0060, DK0061, DK0062, DK0063, and DK0066 from two families with SCKL1 from J.

We previously demonstrated that the stable expression of C/EBP\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, or \u025b was capable of conferring LPS-induced IL-6 and MCP-1 expression to a murine B lymphoblast cell line . In our previous studies, we overexpressed C/EBP\u03b2 (LAP) to confer LPS-inducible expression of IL-6 and MCP-1 to a B lymphoblast cell line . This region suppressed C/EBP\u03b2 activity in MCP-1 expression, but not IL-6 expression in a B lymphoblast cell line.
The final protocol included normal lymphoblast cell lines (GM0892 and GM3798) and human ataxia telangiectasia lymphplastoid cell lines (GM1525/AT2BI/AT1 and GM1526/AT8BI/AT2) as the assay quality control, which were treated with ETOP of different concentrations for 2 h before the culture medium was replaced, and the cells were then cultured for additional 4 h for the repair.

A significant increase in aconitases activity was observed in patient-derived lymphoblast cell line FRDA 214 after treatment with UCM108 for 5 days (Fig.\u00a06C).
The lymphoblast cell lines were derived from patients carrying the following homozygous mutations in different subunits; in eIF2B\u03b5: T91A and R113H; in eIF2B\u03b2: E213G; and in eIF2B\u03b4: R374C. To confirm the reduced eIF2B activity in VWM-patient-derived lymphoblasts, as reported earlier , GDP\u2013GTP exchange on eIF2 was measured in a number of lymphoblast cell lines. For many of the subsequent studies, immortalized lymphoblast cell lines were used. Although the bands for the lymphoblast cell lines look stronger, when corrected for the amount of tubulin (Fig. 2A, right-hand panel), it is clear that the eIF2\u00b7eIF2B ratio was not significantly affected. A similar experiment was carried out with one control and one VWM lymphoblast cell line in which the cells were exposed to increased temperature (30 min, 44\u00b0C). We measured reduced eIF2B activity in lymphoblast cell lines of several VWM patients (Fig. 1). A lymphoblast cell line from a new blood sample was prepared for patient \u03b2E213G(I).
Glutaraldehyde induced DNA\u2013protein cross-links, and unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in a TK6 human lymphoblast cell line . TFT resistance (mutation) was induced in a human TK6 lymphoblast cell line at concentrations of 5\u201320 \u03bcM . Glutaraldehyde produced a dose-related increase in TK mutants in a human lymphoblast cell line and was mutagenic only at the highest, non-toxic concentration in L5178Y cells, but did not produce mutation at the Hgprt locus in CHO cells in two studies (Table 5).
The human lymphoblast cell line U937 does not express Bcr\u2013Abl, but expresses similar surface markers (CD3\u2212, CD13+, CD19\u2212, CD34\u2212) and is morphologically comparable to K562 cells.

As described previously , an isogenic uncorrected/corrected pair of lymphoblast cell lines was prepared from the FANCA-deficient HSC72 cell line, by introducing a wild type FANCA cDNA. An additional wildtype lymphoblast cell line, GM07057, was included as a positive control. The specificity of the assay is confirmed based on an abundance of evidence, including nine criteria that exceed widely recognized best practices for targeted peptide measurements : (i) The sequence (QLSSTVFK) is unique to the FANCD2 protein, based on a blast search of the uniprot human protein database; (ii) The proteotypic peptide analyte QLSSTVFK (\u00b1monoubiquitination) and its synthetic, stable isotope-labeled internal standards co-elute (i.e. have the same retention time and peak shape) during the liquid chromatography separation; (iii) Three independent transitions are detected for each peptide, consistent with best practices ; (iv) The transitions from the analyte peptides and internal standards have the same relative abundances, again consistent with best practices ; (v) The linear response of the assay follows expected behavior using spiked analytes and standards; (vi) The unmodified FANCD2 analyte peptide is not detected in the biological samples (i.e., Fanconi patient PBMCs) known to lack functional FANCD2 protein (Fig. 2B); (vii) The monoubiquitinated FANCD2 analyte peptide is not detected in the biological samples (lymphoblast cell lines, patient PBMCs) known to lack expression of the FANCD2 or FANCA proteins (Fig. 2A\u2013B); (viii) MRM-based detection of the monoubiquitinated FANCD2 analyte peptide is restored in the FANCA-deficient cell line when the wild type FANCA gene is added back to the cells (Fig. 2A); (ix) The quantity of the monoubiquitinated proteoform detected by the assay is increased following treatment of cells with a DNA cross-linking agent (MMC) (Fig. 2A\u2013B), consistent with known biology.

In previous studies, we found that the stable expression of C/EBP\u03b2 in a murine B lymphoblast cell line is sufficient to confer LPS-inducible IL-6 expression, thus establishing an essential role for C/EBP transcription factors in IL-6 expression . Our own work has shown that the stable expression of C/EBP\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4 or \u025b in a murine B lymphoblast cell line is sufficient to confer LPS-inducible IL-6 expression .

For each patient, total RNA was extracted, and a lymphoblast cell line was initiated. Our original report (Slaugenhaupt et al.  suggested that lymphoblast cell lines from patients with FD were capable of expressing WT IKBKAP transcript from the mutant FD allele. To address this discrepancy, we obtained the GM5106 FD cell line used by Anderson et al. from the Coriell Mutant Cell Repository and compared it with a frozen GM5106 stock already present in our laboratory, as well as with independent lymphoblast cell lines from other patients homozygous for the major mutation. We employed densitometry as a rapid assay to characterize the relative WT:MU transcript ratio of 81 FD lymphoblast cell lines. To assess whether the efficiency of accurate IKBKAP splicing might vary over time, we used four independent lymphoblast cell lines (MIN9741, MIN9744, MIN9745, and MIN9754) from patients with FD who were homozygous for the major mutation.
Moreover, the lymphoblast cell line did not show increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation.
A reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV)-transformed chicken lymphoblast cell line, CU205, and chicken splenic lymphocytes which were isolated by Ficoll-Paque\u2122 (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone), 2 mM

Therefore, we incubated Y.\u00a0pestis with KFL-9 cells, a mammalian lymphoblast cell line that produces membrane-bound FasL, and examined the ability of Pla to degrade FasL associated with these cells. Jurkat cells and KFL-9 cells (undifferentiated lymphoblast cell line that constitutively expresses human FasL) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro; Mediatech) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone; Thermo).
Studies in this laboratory used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to examine a human lymphoblast cell line (GM 09948) revealed that HQ produces significant loss of one hybridization signal for chromosomes 5, 7, and 8 [23]. Previous studies in this laboratory using FISH to analyze a human lymphoblast cell line (GM 09948) revealed that 26\u201349 \u03bcM HQ produces significant loss of one hybridization signal for chromosomes 5, 7, and 8 [23].

The lymphoblasts were infected by Epstein-Barr viruses and then, Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblast cell lines were established. Infection with Epstein-Barr virus in vitro easily transforms resting B cells obtained from human peripheral blood into actively proliferating lymphoblast cell lines. Previously, we used a gene array to examine expressions in Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblast cell line and B cell from the same control subject. To date, lymphoblast cell lines have been used for a variety of purposes, such as sources of DNA, cells to study various genetic disorders, and the study of cell biology. We prepared the human lymphoblast cell lines used in the present study using cells obtained from MwA patients and healthy controls. Moreover, lymphoblast cell lines could be used to customize treatments, since lymphoblasts carry an individual's genetic information.

The HUT-78 cell line is a zinc sensitive human-derived Th0-lymphoblast cell line that exhibits characteristics of TH1 lymphocytes when stimulated . HUT-78 cells represent a mature TH0 lymphoblast cell line; thus, we were not surprised to find that many genes involved in early T-cell development were not significantly changed.
In an in vitro model using microsomes from a human lymphoblast cell line the S-enantiomer was shown to be extensively metabolised by CYP2D6 and to a relatively smaller extent by CYP1A2, the R-enantiomer was metabolised to a relatively small extent by CYP3A4.

We previously proposed that human lymphoblast cell lines originating from migraine-attack-free MA patients might be useful as a novel model for investigating the pathophysiology of migraine . In fact, lymphoblast cell lines originating from migraine-attack-free MA patients have been shown to exhibit a dysfunction in serotonin metabolism . In the present study, we investigated differences in the gene expression patterns of human lymphoblast cell lines originating from migraine-attack-free patients and healthy controls.

However, because animal model expressing the Mre11 nuclease dead mutant at a homozygous status (Mre11H129N/H129N) and human MRE11\u2212/H129N lymphoblast cell lines are unviable ; , , we surmise that RAD50E1035\u0394 does not abolish MRE11 nuclease activity in\u00a0vivo and/or that an alternative mechanism allows it to cope with defective MRE11-dependent DNA end resection in\u00a0P1.

To compare cell lines and their exosomes, we applied the epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431, the lymphoma cell line U937 and the lymphoblast cell line K562 to the commercially available PEA panel (Proseek Oncology 1 v2) containing markers for cancer (supplemental Table S1). To further explore the potential of PEA for tracing the cell line origin of exosomes, the same analysis was applied on extended data for lysates and exosomes (Data set 2, supplemental Table S2), from the lymphoma cell line U937 and the lymphoblast cell line K562 as above and also from four additional cell lines; two human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 (bone metastasis) and DU145 (brain metastasis), the human epithelial colorectal carcinoma HCT116; and the mammary gland epithelial breast cancer cell line MCF7 (Fig. 2

To identify a critical region of FANCE required for promoting the FANCD2 monoubiquitination and the FA pathway, we made serial truncations of FANCE and expressed them in a patient-derived FANCE null lymphoblast cell line, EUFA130.
Most experiments involved the comparison of three lymphoblast cell lines from individuals with FRDA versus three cell lines from healthy subjects. An additional FRDA lymphoblast cell line, OK22 (400 and 860 repeats), was established in the laboratory. However, in NOMe-Seq and RNA-Seq assays, we compared two FRDA versus two non-FRDA lymphoblast cell lines; in these assays, FRDA-1 and FRDA-2 refer to GM15850 and OK22, and CNTR-1 and CNTR-2 refer to GM22647 and GM22671, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from two non-FRDA (GM22647 and GM22671) and two FRDA (GM15850 and OK22) lymphoblast cell lines. Chromatin accessibility at FXN-TSS2 was measured in three FRDA and three non-FRDA lymphoblast cell lines.
By contrast, P values for the tagging SNPs rs2069422, rs2069426, rs3218018, and rs2811712 were all greater than 0.01 (Table 5); in skin and lymphoblast cell line samples, neither rs1063192 nor rs3217992 returned P values less than 0.01.

Although SD1 is a pre-B-lymphoblast cell line, the presence of lysosomes and proteins associated with lipid raft formation (which include the Src kinases CSK, LYN, FGR, and LCK) suggested the possibility that RAC2 activation was being initiated by BCR signaling.
Furthermore, the stable expression of C/EBP\u03b2 in a murine B lymphoblast cell line is sufficient to confer LPS inducibility of IL-6 expression , and the activity of the C/EBP\u03b2 bZIP in the absence of N-terminal motifs required the NF-\u03baB site of the IL-6 promoter .
Human lymphoblast cell lines were obtained from a patient suffering from the Golabi-Ito-Hall syndrome and a healthy control subject matched for age, gender, and race . Likewise, an interaction between endogenous PQBP1 and WBP11 could not be detected by co-immunoprecipitation analysis in a lymphoblast cell line from a patient with GIH but could be readily visualized in lymphoblasts from a healthy person matched for age, gender, and race (Fig. 4\nB).
As reported by Choy et al. , many transcript phenotypes in these same lymphoblast cell lines were linked to the growth rate and ATP levels of the individual cell lines.
Immortalized lymphoblast cell lines were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository (Coriell Institute for Medical Research) and the Biospecimens Accessioning Processing Laboratory (Mayo Clinic).

The C1R B lymphoblast cell line was transduced for stable expression of MICA using an improved murine stem-cell virus (MSCV)\u2013based bicistronic MIEG3 retroviral vector with EGFP.
We further confirmed the observed interaction between the NPM fusions and endogenous NPM using a normal lymphoblast cell line that expressed FLAG-NPM or FLAG-NPM\u0394C (Figure 7C).
Two separate studies examining both the Jurkat T lymphoblast cell line and multiple myeloma cell lines suggested that caspase activation was important., Although we found Raji cell lines and primary CLL cells undergo apoptosis through a caspase-independent mechanism as described herein, subsequent investigation of the Ramos cell line demonstrates caspase activation to be important to FTY720-mediated death, as observed in other cell types., It is very interesting that FTY720 can work through caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms in different cell types.
We first assessed the effects of actinomycin D on the CH106 lymphoblast cell line derived from a patient with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) who harbored a heterozygous mutation (IVS1\u20132, A>G) in the ribosomal protein gene RPS19. Interestingly, all 3 lymphoblast cell lines derived from SDS patients also exhibited hypersensitivity to actinomycin D relative to the normal control (Figure 2A). The SDS lymphoblast cell line DF259 was infected with a lentiviral vector carrying either GFP alone or together with a downstream IRES\u2013wild-type SBDS cDNA sequence. We observed that 28S rRNA coprecipitated with the anti-SBDS antibody but not with preimmune serum (Figure 3B, lane 2) in lysates from HeLa cells or control lymphoblast cell lines, which express SBDS protein (Figure 3B, lanes 3 and 4).
Further, studies have shown impairment of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering in HD lymphoblast cell line and brain mitochondria from the full-length mutant huntingtin transgenic mice (YAC72) , . Panov et al. ,  demonstrated diminished Ca2+ uptake capacity in mitochondria from HD lymphoblast cell lines, and brain mitochondria from the full-length mutant huntingtin-overexpressing mice (YAC72) , whereas others demonstrated diminished Ca2+ uptake in muscle mitochondria from R6/2 mice . Panov et al. ,  reported decreased Ca2+ uptake in mitochondria from HD lymphoblast cell line, and brain mitochondria from full-length huntingtin transgenic mice (YAC72).
Differential regulation of the 5 different 5\u2032 GR transcripts has been shown in 2 separate studies with the CEM-C7 T lymphoblast cell line as model system, in which GC treatment specifically led to the up-regulation of 1A3 promoter transcripts., However, in the present study we did not detect a significant difference in the GC-induced expression levels of any of the 5 different 5\u2032 GR promoter transcripts in either the total study population or when analyzing the prednisolone-sensitive versus -resistant patient samples.
An Epstein-Barr virus transformed B-lymphoblast cell line and primary dermal fibroblast cultures from a VDR-RXR-normal patient with classical symptoms of hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR) were used as a source for REBiP .
The FANCA functionally null GM6914 cell line has been previously described, as has wild-type lymphoblast cell line PD7. Primary fibroblasts (.F) were obtained from skin biopsy, and lymphoblast cell lines (.L) were obtained by immortalization of peripheral blood lymphocytes.
Conversely, an auto-down-regulation of GR levels is frequently observed in cells resistant to hormone-mediated apoptosis, such as the pre-B-lymphoblast cell line, IM-9, and the lowered GR concentration actually dampens GC signaling , , . These results suggest that although Ets family members may be involved in basal promoter activity, c-Ets-1, c-Ets-2, and PU.1 block DEX activation of the hGR 1A promoter in this T-lymphoblast cell line. Thus, we propose that the expression pattern of specific transcription factors, such as PU.1 and c-Myb, in different lymphoblast cell lineages may be largely responsible for determining the direction of the auto-regulatory response of the hGR 1A promoter to hormone.
The enriched cells were then cloned by limiting dilution analysis (LDA) over irradiated (40 Gy) allogeneic PBMCs and partially matched lymphoblast cell line (LCL) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% human serum, IL-2 (100 U/mL), IL-7 (25 ng/mL), and phytohemagglutinin (PHA; 5 \u03bcg/mL; Sigma).

\nCells\u2014The human T cell line Jurkat J-32 and the human B lymphoblast cell line SKW6.4 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 m
The accumulation of PKR on the FANCC protein in FA lymphoblast cell lines (Figs. 1 and 2) and primary BM cells from FA patients (Fig. 3) suggests that FANCC binds to PKR and then recruits other components to the complex, resulting in the displacement of FANCC and control of PKR activity. We observed a 3-4-fold increase of FANCC-bound PKR in BM cell extracts of the FA-A and FA-G patients (Fig. 3) and a lymphoblast cell line that expresses a missense mutated FANCC protein (Figs. 1 and 2).

We have previously demonstrated that the stable expression of C/EBP\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, and \u03b5 in a B lymphoblast cell line is sufficient to confer lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inducibility of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) expression . In this report, we have unexpectedly found that C/EBP\u03b3 dramatically augments the activity of C/EBP\u03b2 in LPS induction of IL-6 in a B lymphoblast cell line.
Consistent with previous studies,retroviral transduction with pMMP-puro FANCE or pMMP-puro HA-FANCE corrected the MMC sensitivity of 3 independent FA-E lymphoblast cell lines\u2014EUFA130 (Figure 1A), EUFA410, and EUFA622 (data not shown).
We were unable to detect wild-type transcript in lymphoblast cell lines and thus could not further study the structure of the CFC1 transcript in this patient.

B-lymphoblast cell lines were from a subset of the mood disorder patients and age- and gender-matched healthy subjects on whom we have previously reported [Ca2+]B\n(Emamghoreishi et al 1997).
The PD4 lymphoblast cell line is heterozygous for a frameshift mutation in one allele, predicting a truncated peptide of the amino-terminal 44 amino acids, and a nonsense mutation in the other allele, predicting a terminated peptide of 185 residues. Therefore, we introduced the 6 mutants along with the normal FANCC as well as the retroviral vector alone into the normal lymphoblast cell line JY. The ability of the FANCC protein to accommodate these substitutions without an impact on the MMC resistance function of the mutants may explain the recent finding that bovine FANCC is able to complement a FA-C patient-derived lymphoblast cell line HSC536N, even though the sequence between the 2 FANCCs are only 72% identical.
The TF-1 lymphoblast cell line; Jurkat, a T-lymphocyte cell line; CEM, an acute T lymphoblast cell line; BV-173, a B-cell precursor cell line; K-562, a chronic myeloid cell line; KG1 and KG1a, acute myeloid cell lines; and SUPB13, an acute B lymphoblastic cell line were obtained through the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD; SUPB13, a gift from Steve Smith at the University of Chicago, Chicago, IL).
The human B lymphoblast cell line SKW6.4 (obtained from Dr. J. Moyano Laboratori d'Investigaci\u00f3, MERCK Qu\u0131\u0301mica, Barcelona, Spain) and the human T cell line Jurkat J32 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 m

The EBV-transformed lymphoblast cell line HSC536N (a gift from Manuel Buchwald) was derived from peripheral blood cells of a child with FA-C. Cells of the FA-C EBV-transformed lymphoblast cell lines HSC536N and the non-FA-C EBV-transformed cell line JY were exposed to an agonistic anti-fas antibody and a suboptimal (for normal cells) \u201cpriming\u201d dose of IFN-\u03b3 (1 ng/mL) for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes.

Keryer et al. subsequently studied the distribution of RII isoforms \u03b1 and \u03b2 in a human lymphoblast cell line, finding the RII-\u03b2 localized to the Golgi-centrosomal area. The characteristics of the 350-kDa AKAP that we have cloned appear similar to those of the centrosomal AKAP350 identified by Keryer et al.  in an RII blot overlay of isolated centrosome proteins from the KE37 human lymphoblast cell line.
The following study was designed to investigate the regulation of non-pituitary hPRL gene expression by assessing the endogenous PRL gene in human lymphoblast cell lines in which the gene is either active or quiescent and thus to identify potential regulatory regions.
EBV-transformed B-lymphoblast cell lines were established from peripheral B lymphocytes of a single patient with Scott syndrome (patient MS; now deceased) as previously described. RT-PCR was performed on RNA isolated from each of three Scott and three normal control EBV-transformed B-lymphoblast cell lines, using oligonucleotides specific for MDR1 and MDR3, respectively. Although the rate of dye efflux varied somewhat from cell line to cell line, each of the three Scott B-lymphoblast cell lines tested was capable of actively extruding Rh123, and no significant difference in MDR1 Pgp activity was discerned between the Scott and normal control cell lines (data not shown). Expression of PL scramblase RNA was examined in three different Scott and three normal control B-lymphoblast cell lines. RT-PCR performed with the same B-lymphoblast cell lines indicated the presence of PL scramblase cDNA in Scott cells of the same size as that found in normal control lymphoblasts (Fig 4). ) was also confirmed by sequencing of cDNA obtained from duplicate RT-PCR reactions performed for three different Scott B-lymphoblast cell lines.

EBV-transformed normal human lymphoblast cell lines, JY, or Niemann-Pick disease lymphoblast MS1418 , were a generous gift from Dr. Richard Kolesnick, Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York. To examine the role of SMase in UV-induced JNK activation directly, we compared the activation of JNK by UV irradiation between EBV-transformed normal human lymphoblast cell line, JY, and EBV-transformed SMase-deficient (2\u223c3% residual acid SMase activity) lymphoblast cell line, MS1418. UV irradiation markedly induced JNK activation in normal human lymphoblast, JY, while only very weak JNK activation was found in MS1418, a SMase-deficient lymphoblast cell line. In the lymphoblast cell system, marked UV-induced JNK activation is observed in a normal human lymphoblast, JY, but only a little activation of JNK in MS1418, a SMase- deficient (2 \u223c3% residual acid SMase activity) lymphoblast cell line.

FeLV antibody was determined by an ELISA using sucrose density-gradient purified whole FeLV (KT isolated from the FL74 lymphoblast cell line) as antigen, feline test serum, and peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-feline IgG as the secondary reagent (Miles Scientific, Naperville, IL).
The IM-9 cell line is a B lymphoblast cell line that has a relatively high level of functional glucocorticoid receptors but is not killed by glucocorticoids.,IM-9 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37\u00b0C in a 5% C02/ 95% air atmosphere.
\nMarrow MNCs (0.5 to 1.5 \u00d7 105/mL) were cultured with 0.5 U/mL of human urinary Ep (1,140 National Institutes of Health [NIH] 1,140 U/mg protein) in triplicate 0.25-mL aliquots containing 1.1% methylcellulose, 50 \u03bc mo/L 2-mercaptoethanol, and 15% to 30% FCS with or without 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Mo-conditioned medium (MoCM, a medium conditioned by a T lymphoblast cell line containing both colony-stimulating activity and erythroid burst-promoting activity [BPA].

Comparable results were reported with conditioned medium from the GCT cell line.We recently purified a 22,000-molecular weight (mol wt) GM-CSF from medium conditioned by the Mo-T-lymphoblast cell line.Complementary DNA clones encoding this human T cell-derived GM-CSF have been isolated, and there is about 60% homology with the nucleotide sequence of the murine GM-CSF cDNA.
Marrow or peripheral blood MNCs were cultured (5 to 15 \u00d7 10/mL) with 1 unit human urinary erythropoietin (NIH, 1, 140 U/mg protein) in triplicate 1-mL aliquots containing 1.1% methyl-cellulose, 50 \u03bcmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, and 30% FCS, with or without 1% Mo-conditioned medium (Mo CM, a medium conditioned by a T lymphoblast cell line, containing both myeloid colony-stimulating activity and erythroid burst-promoting activity [BPA] and kindly provided by Dr David Golde. Because the Mo CM used in our studies was derived from a T lymphoblast cell line, we examined human marrow and peripheral blood BFU-E growth, before and after T cell depletion, in cultures without Mo CM but containing erythropoietin and reduced concentrations of FCS to optimize detection of BPA.
The potential of SCM to stimulate the growth of hematopoietic precursor cells was compared with that of peripheral mononuclear cell conditioned medium (LCM) and conditioned medium from a human T lymphoblast cell line (MoCM)\u2014two major sources found to stimulate the growth of human CFU-GEMM.

Natural killer (NK) cell activity against cell line K562 and killer (K) cell antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against antibody-coated B-lymphoblast cell line SB were tested as previously described. As shown in Table 3, the patient's cells had moderate NK and K cell activity, as measured, respectively, by spontaneous lysis of K562 target cells and antibodycoated B-lymphoblast cell line SB. The cells also showed modest K cell ADCC activity, as measured by lysis of the antibody-coated B-lymphoblast cell line SB.
In later studies, T cells and T-cell conditioned media increased human burst formation by the null cell fraction, and the human T-lymphoblast cell line, Mo, was found to produce erythroid-enhancing activity. This is a major advantage of this material over other sources of BPA, such as lectin-stimulated spleen conditioned media and T-lymphoblast cell line CM, for studies on the mode of action of BPA.
We recently found that a human T-lymphoblast cell line (Mo) elaborates a 45,000 molecular weight glycoprotein with erythroid-potentiating activity.

McDonald), and a human T-lymphoblast cell line conditioned medium (TC-CM, donated by Dr. David Golde). The addition of media conditioned by a human T-lymphoblast cell line (final concentration 10%), a known source of burst promoting and colony stimulating activities, also failed to enhance colony formation, both alone and with the concomitant addition of erythropoietin (Fig. 10
The source of the factor is a T-lymphoblast cell line (Mo) that was derived from a patient with a T-cell variant of hairy-cell leukemia.\u201d The cell line constitutively produces and liberates into the medium several modulators of hematopoiesis, including a CSF and an activity that potentiates erythroid colony formation in vitro. The Mo T-lymphoblast cell line constitutively elaborates various products known to be produced by mitogen-stimulated normal T lymphocytes.

In the course of a study of T cell leukemia antigens we found that a rabbit antiserum to a human T lymphoblast cell line had cytotoxic activity not only against E rosette-positive lymphoblasts from children with T cell leukemia, but also against lymphoblasts from two of six children with null cell leukemia. In this study we document the T and B cell specificity of antisera prepared by reciprocal absorption of rabbit antisera to autologous T and B lymphoblast cell lines HSB-2 and SB and the reactivity of these antisera for lymphoblasts from children with null cell ALL. The derivation and maintenance of lymphoblast cell lines HSB-2, SB, RAJI, and RPMI 7666 have been previously described. To determine the T cell and B cell specificity of the anti-T cell line and anti-B cell line sera, we measured their reactivity by indirect immunofluorescence against (1) pure T and B cell populations present in T and B lymphoblast cell lines; (2) lymphocyte suspensions enriched for B cells (by nylon column filtration), T cells (by E rosette depletion) or null cells (by sequential nylon column filtration and E rosette depletion), and (3) lymphocyte suspensions enriched for T lymphoblasts by phytohemagglutinin or concanavalin A stimulation.
The chromatographic pattern of low molecular weight RNA from infectious mononucleosis lymphoblasts and the lymphoblast cell line derived from a normal donor (1788) are similar, as shown in Fig. 2 These results are similar to the patterns found with the Burkitt lymphoma lymphoblast cell line and the lymphoblast cell line isolated from a normal donor (1788), i.e., the type of differences found between Burkitt lymphoma lymphoblasts and the lymphoblasts isolated from a normal donor is mimicked by the differences between the EB-virus transformed and PHA- transformed lymphoblasts. These have consisted of the presence of an extra species of tRNA for aspartic acid in human myeloma cells compared to the lymphoblast cell line 1788, and the same extra species of tRNA for aspartic acid in cells transformed by each of the major oncogenic DNA viruses (SV-40, polyoma, and adenovirus) compared to the normal control tissue culture cells prior to transformation (unpublished results\u2014R. If relatively large changes were induced simply by exposure to EB virus (either by direct coding or by inducing gene depression), then one might expect that the infectious mononucleosis cells, EB-virus transformed cells, and Burkitt lymphoma cells should be the same but different from the PHA-transformed cells, and possibly also from the \u201cnormal\u201d cell line 1788 (the lymphoblast cell line 1788, derived from a normal donor, may also contain the EB virus genome). The uridine-labeled RNA from PHA-transformed normal peripheral blood lymphoblasts, infectious mononucleosis lymphoblasts, and the \u201cnormal\u201d lymphoblast cell line 1788 show relatively greater amounts of early eluting species and relatively less of the late eluting RNA's, compared to the RNA's of EB-virus transformed cells and the Burkitt cells (which tend to show relatively more of the late eluting and less of the early eluting species).
At least five species have previously been fractionated from a \u201cnormal\u201d and leukemic lymphoblast cell line.
The rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG, in association with protection from A(H7N9) infection (OR = 0.26, P = 5.92 \u00d7 10\u22127) correlated to significantly higher levels of LGALS1 mRNA (P = 0.050) and protein expression (P = 0.025) in lymphoblast cell lines.

Deeper sampling would be required to establish firmly whether intrinsic biological differences between the sexes and/or populations also make significant contributions to expression divergence in lymphocytes, as they appear to do for lymphoblast cell lines grown in culture. Another SNP in BCL11A, rs4671393, has been associated with abundance of two BCL11A transcript isoforms in the CEU (CEPH Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe sample) and YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria) HapMap lymphoblast cell lines, but is not associated with BCL11A transcript abundance in our leukocyte data, suggesting that regulation of BCL11A translation or protein activity is more likely to be affecting HBG1 and HBG2 expression in our sample.

The DNA samples of Japanese human blood cells (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]-transformed B-lymphoblast cell lines) (male, 66; female, 79), which were obtained from unrelated healthy volunteers were purchased from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (JCRB) Cell Bank. After a 411-bp fragment of the KRAS gene was detected in all samples (145 Japanese EBV-transformed B-lymphoblast cell lines and 54 human cancer cell lines), we attempted to detect the BLV provirus in each of the samples using the PCR primers listed in Table\u00a01, but we could not detect the BLV provirus in any of the Japanese EBV-transformed B-lymphoblast cell lines (Table\u00a02) or human cancer cell lines (Table\u00a03) tested in this study. Using new primers, different from those used in previous studies in which BLV proviral DNA was detected in breast tissues in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, and Iran  and in human blood samples in the United States and Iran , we concluded that there is no evidence for BLV-specific sequences in the 145 Japanese EBV-transformed B-lymphoblast cell lines and 54 human cancer cell lines tested in this study. Here, we could not detect BLV proviral DNA in Japanese EBV transformed B-lymphoblast cell lines or human cancer cells.

Unlike reports from macrophages, HIV-1 infection in MOLT-4 T lymphoblast cell line and CD4+ T cells has been suggested by one research group to inhibit autophagy as measured by reduced LC3-II or Beclin-1 levels  (Figure 3B); this indicates that in T-cells the process of autophagy may be a net negative for HIV-1 replication .
ICF and control lymphoblast cell lines have been described previously. Both genes are exclusively expressed in the testis and are silent in somatic tissues, including peripheral blood and lymphoblast cell lines. Both genes are highly expressed in peripheral blood and lymphoblast cell lines and their promoters are associated with histone marks that are specific of an open chromatin. The analysis was carried out on lymphoblast cell lines derived from three ICF patients and two controls. The normal lymphoblast cell lines had very similar replication profiles. Asynchronous exponentially growing lymphoblast cell lines were sequentially pulse-labeled with IdU and CldU and the incorporated DNA analogues were detected by immunostaining of the combed fibers (Supplementary Figure 1). Overall, the median fork speeds measured in ICF and control lymphoblast cell lines were within the range measured in other human cell lines.
To examine the in vivo effect of the three putative functional IL6 promoter variants, \u2212174G>C, \u2212572G>C and \u22126331T>C, two complementary techniques, allele-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation and allele-specific formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements, were carried out using unrelated lymphoblast cell lines of known genotype. asFAIRE was carried out using the same five cell lines as the asChIP analysis, along with 15 additional lymphoblast cell lines.
Samples were purchased as lymphoblast cell lines from the Coriell Cell Repository. As a positive control, we used DNA from an ICF syndrome lymphoblast cell line (GM08714).
The majority of DNA samples were extracted from blood (N\u00a0=\u00a097) and the remaining samples were from EBV-transformed lymphoblast cell lines (Online Resource 1).
Analysis of lymphoblast cell lines derived from affected and unaffected members of family 1 did not display any differences in PFN1 protein solubility (Supplementary Fig. 6).
The molecular consequences of the rearrangement were studied in lymphoblast cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR, and western blot analysis. A specific breakpoint junction product was obtained by PCR of DNA extracted from peripheral blood and confirmed in DNA from transformed lymphoblast cell lines in those samples that carried the duplication (i.e. consultand and father) (Figure 2b). We identified a genomic rearrangement-associated novel fusion gene in the father and consultand daughter exclusively, using RNA extracted from lymphoblast cell lines. We found that relative to control lymphoblast cell lines, the father demonstrated markedly increased MECP2A transcription, consistent with the levels of transcription typically observed in patients carrying MECP2 duplication and triplication (Figure 3c). The latter observation may reflect the fact that the clonally obtained lymphoblast cell lines of the female consultand demonstrated more extensive skewing of X-inactivation (96/4, versus 83/17 in peripheral blood) as a consequence of the cloning passage ; the lack of appreciable increase in expression in the consultand is therefore considered to be equivocal. Proteins were extracted from immortalized lymphoblast cell lines of all available family members and a male and female control cell line. Total RNA was extracted from immortalized lymphoblast cell lines from all family members, three controls without copy number variation in the Xq28 region (CTL01, female control; CTL02, male control; 3059 male control), two individuals carrying MECP2 duplications (BAB2623 and BAB2666), and one individual carrying a MECP2 triplication (BAB2805). Proteins were isolated via acid extraction from confluent cultures of immortalized human lymphoblast cell lines of subjects BA3149, BA3150, BA3169, BA3170, BA3171, a male control individual, and a female control individual.
Furthermore, for carriers of the top-risk allele near OPG, expression of this protein was reduced by half in lymphoblast cell lines. Although lymphoblast cell lines are not bone tissue, lymphocytes are the main source of OPG expression in bone marrow.
In one family, Southern blot analyses performed using DNA extracted from lymphoblast cell lines showed pathogenic repeat expansions of 700\u20131,600 repeat units; however, the minimal repeat size required for disease manifestation may be considerably smaller.
Specifically, the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism is thought to reduce the transcription efficiency for the gene, resulting in a decreased expression of the serotonin transporter and decreased serotonin uptake in lymphoblast cell lines and blood platelets (Greenberg et al. ; Lesch et al.  and a decreased availability of the serotonin transporter in human imaging studies (Heinz et al. .
A recent study has shown that the EBV encoded protein EBNA3 is a possible binding partner of VDR, and that EBNA3 - VDR interaction blocks activation of VDR dependent gene expression, which protects EBV immortalized lymphoblast cell lines from vitamin D3 induced growth arrest and apoptosis .
A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of MIF \u2212173 G/C is known to influence MIF promoter activity in T lymphoblast cell lines and is associated with a higher serum MIF level. The MIF \u2212173 G/C (rs755622) polymorphism is located in the promoter region, and has been shown to influence MIF promoter activity in T lymphoblast cell lines . Luciferase studies in a human T lymphoblast cell line have shown increased promoter activity of MIF \u2212173 C-Luc compared with MIF \u2212173 G-Luc .
In parallel with the in utero exposure study, in vitro studies using a human lymphoblast cell line exposed to arsenic were also carried out. A lymphoblast cell line (RPMI1788), established from human peripheral blood lymphocytes (profile# TKG0464), was obtained from the ATCC (#CCL-156). The level of total 5-MedC content in the treated lymphoblast cell line was not significantly different from the untreated levels except at six weeks of treatment, which significantly reduced (p < 0.01) at six weeks of treatment, both at 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM. Two weeks of treatment with arsenite showed no effect on p53 promoter methylation in the lymphoblast cell line, but a dramatic increase (approximately 300 % of the control level) was observed at four weeks (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 at arsenite concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM, respectively), with a subsequent decrease to control levels by six weeks. To achieve a better understanding of the epigenetic effects of arsenic exposure, DNA methylation was further investigated in vitro, through short-term and long-term exposure using a human lymphoblast cell line.

The expression of the brain-specific CBLN1 gene was not quantifiable because it was low in all of lymphoblast cell lines. In relation to the remaining genes (ORC6L, ABCC12, N4BP1, SALL1, HERPUD and CKLF), we could not draw any conclusions because of their low level of expression in the lymphoblast cell lines or the variability of expression in the control samples (GPT2). Briefly, RNA was extracted from the patient and controls lymphoblast cell lines using Trizol (Gibco BRL.
Compared with SLC6A4*L, SLC6A4*S results in lower transcriptional efficiency, decreased SERT expression and, therefore, decreased uptake of serotonin in a lymphoblast cell line.

Functional roles of these SNPs were evaluated by screening cis-eQTLs in transformed lymphoblast cell lines available for a sub-group of Genetics of NIDDM (GENNID) families from Arkansas. Six T2D GWAS SNPs (rs6698181, rs9472138, rs730497, rs10811661, rs11037909 and rs1153188) were associated with nearby transcript expression in transformed lymphoblast cell lines of GENNID AA subjects. Six SNPs (rs6698181, rs9472138, rs730497, rs10811661, rs11037909 and rs1153188) were associated with nearby transcript expression in transformed lymphoblast cell lines of GENNID subjects in both general and within-family analyses using generalized estimating equations (Table 2). Our gene expression arrays were unable to detect significant expression of the JAZF1 transcripts in GENNID transformed lymphoblast cell lines. Thus, a limitation of the current screening of eQTLs in this study was that we only had transformed lymphoblast cell line gene expression data available for the reported GWAS SNPs. However, several studies revealed that eQTLs in tissues relevant to T2D and associated metabolic disorders (for example, adipose) significantly overlap with eQTLs in lymphoblast cell lines.
Most colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) were purified from media conditioned by various human tumor cells, and it is noteworthy that tumors secreting CSFs include not only hematopoietic cancers, such as a T-lymphoblast cell line , but also a human squamous cell line from a lower oral cavity  and a gastric cancer cell line , which are not related to hematopoiesis.
In vitro techniques that can be applied to investigate gene expression under basal conditions and in response to challenge e.g., drugs (cocaine, citralopram) or transcription factors (CTCF) include: (1) Production of polymorphism-reporter gene constructs to examine the ability of a polymorphism to alter gene expression in clonal or primary cell lines (Klenova et al. ; Guindalini et al. ; Roberts et al. ; Ali et al. ; Vasiliou et al. ; (2) Quantitative or real-time PCR in lymphoblast cell lines of known genotype to determine relative quantities of gene expression as a function of a specific genotype (Hranilovic et al. ; (3) Allelic expression imbalance (AEI) that can determine the relative abundance of transcript derived in an allele-specific manner (Lim et al. ; Martin et al. .

Given that about one third of mutations affect gene expression levels, we reasoned that transcriptome profiling of lymphoblast cell lines from XLID patients may highlight genes harboring disease-causing mutations and may be an efficient follow-up method for rare sequence variants of unknown functional significance. We analyzed expression profiles of lymphoblast cell lines from 64 XLID patients, including 13 cases that were part of a recent X-chromosome exon re-sequencing study (Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Table 1). To test whether CCDC22 downregulation occurred frequently in the general population we analyzed CCDC22 expression level in 52 age-matched control males using genome-wide expression data from lymphoblast cell lines from an AGRE cohort (Methods).

Besides neuropathology, neuroimaging and cognitive behavioral testing, lymphoblast cell lines have been widely used in studies involved in pharmacogenetics (Hashem et al. , neurodegeneration (Acehan et al. ; Panov et al. ; Toneff et al. , transcriptional profiling (Abuhatzira et al. , and the development of new medications (Hashem et al. . The advantages of using lymphoblast cell lines are the easy access of peripheral blood and a well-established protocol for the establishment of lymphoblast cell lines. In addition to the versatile applications of lymphoblast cell lines, genomic profiles and cellular responses correlated with disease progression could be closely monitored due to the fact that peripheral blood could be collected at different stages of HD. Furthermore, lymphoblast cell lines established at different stages of HD could be a powerful tool for evaluating the efficacy of novel therapies and chemicals that were designed to target specific stages of HD, thus stage specific response to novel treatment could also be determined. Therefore, lymphoblast cell lines in HD monkeys are unique tools for monitoring the alteration of genomic and cellular function in HD, which could be correlated with neuroimaging, cognitive and behavioral changes in HD monkeys longitudinally.

Finally, the cytotoxicity of SJG-136 was also evaluated in the lymphoblast cell lines. ABCB1 gene expression was determined in a subset of 20 lymphoblast cell lines from the panel of 53 previously genotyped, corresponding to genotypes showing different P-gp expression in 3T3 fibroblasts. The calcein uptake was determined on 13 out of the 20 lymphoblast cell lines (Figure 3b).

The cytotoxicity of SJG-136 was also evaluated in eight lymphoblast cell lines (Table 3). This was confirmed by the cytotoxicity data using SJG-136: while the drug sensitivity was correlated with the gene expression of ABCB1 in isogenic 3T3 fibroblasts, there was no correlation in lymphoblast cell lines.

In lymphoblast cell lines, the 5-HTT promoter fragments containing the long or short variant demonstrated differential stimulus-inducible response to stimuli such as forskolin or phorbol ester treatment, again with the long allele displaying proportionally greater responses .
Interestingly, Parle-McDermott et al.  reported that DHFR mRNA expression was 50% higher in lymphoblast cell lines with the del/del genotype than in cell lines with the ins/ins genotype.
In this study, two isogenic human B lymphoblast cell lines with different p53 status include TK6 containing wild-type p53 and WTK1 with mutant p53 were used and contrasted. Two close-related human B lymphoblast cell lines, TK6 with wild-type p53 and WTK1 with mutated p53 at condon 237, were used to compare p16ink4A and DNA methylation levels. In this study, we report a p53 mutation in a human lymphoblast cell line resulted in loss of suppression on DNMT1 expression.

We have also examined the expression of CYFIP1, NIPA2, GOLGA8E, and WHDC1L1 using RNAs derived from lymphoblast cell lines from AS patients with a class I deletion and no evidence of allele-specific expression was found (data not shown).
The short allele results in lower transcriptional efficiency of the 5-HT transporter, decreased transporter expression, and therefore decreased uptake of 5-HT in a lymphoblast cell line .
The authors looked at almost 4,000 genes in at least two clonal human B lymphoblast cell lines and found that more than 300 genes showed random monoallelic expression, although most also showed biallelic expression in some cell clones.
The fact that this patient exhibited clinical features highly suggestive of CLS prompted us to investigate the expression of the RSK2 protein by Western blot analysis using a lymphoblast cell line. Our previous results have shown that there is always a small unspecific background activity with samples immunoprecipitated from lymphoblast cell lines and that the assay is not capable to discriminate a specific residual RSK2 kinase activity of less than 20% from this background activity. This might be due to the presence of small amounts of other RSKs (all RSKs are expressed at high levels in lymphoblast cell lines) in these samples.
In addition, they provide evidence of decreased NADH levels in a lymphoblast cell line derived from an MTS patient caused by a decrease in the aspartate-glutamate shuttle, suggesting that a defect in this mechanism may be the molecular basis of the syndrome.
LIT1 RNA signals were observed in almost all interphase nuclei of the lymphoblast cell line (97% of interphase nuclei) and of four fibroblast cell lines (98, 91, 94, 94% of interphase nuclei; Table\u00a01). The UBE3A RNA was visible in only 65% of the lymphoblast cell line and in only 59, 61, 61, 54% of the four fibroblast cell lines, respectively (Fig.\u00a02g\u2013j; Table\u00a01).

Fourteen Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblast cell lines containing HD alleles with repeat sizes ranging from 15 to 100 were selected from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Human Genetic Cell Repository at Coriell Cell Repositories.
One SNP (rs2272080) located around the exon 1 untranslated region was nominally associated with schizophrenia (P=0.024) and significantly associated with the expression of PPP3CC in lymphoblast cell line; the TT and TG genotype had significantly higher relative expression levels than the GG genotype (P=0.0012 and 0.015, respectively).
In another study, an analysis of 70 cassette-alternative exons in lymphoblast cell lines from 22 individuals identified 6 exons that exhibited variable skip-inclusion ratios between individuals that correlated with closely associated SNPs.
Control subjects consisted of two groups: (1) 372 unrelated healthy volunteers were employees of the University of Tokushima and related hospitals; (2) 521 Epstein-Barr virus transformed B-lymphoblast cell lines, derived from unrelated healthy volunteers and established by the Pharma SNP consortium (PSC), were obtained through the Japan Health Sciences Foundation (JHSF)/Health Science Research Resources Bank (HSRRB).
Only subjects with lymphoblast cell lines were included on the plate set, although a substantial number of the DNA samples on the plate set were derived from whole blood or buffy coat. Genomic DNA derived from whole blood or buffy coat was phenol-chloroform extracted and DNA from immortalized lymphoblast cell lines was salt-precipitate extracted.
In ataxia telangectasia lymphoblast cell lines (GM 01526 (A-T)), endogenous H4 localized to the cytoplasm and was excluded from the nucleus; etoposide treatment had no effect on this distribution (Figure 3Ce and g) compared to controls (GM 02184 (WT)) (Figure 3Ca and c).
These results were subsequently confirmed on an established lymphoblast cell line.
Additionally, in six AdCs (H1395, H1437, H2009, H2087, H2122 and H2347) and four SCCs (H209, H2107, H2141, and H2171), corresponding lymphoblast cell lines were available for analysis.

Patient\u2019s chromosomes derived from lymphoblast cell lines were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma).
Similar results are observed in reported data on gene expression in human lymphoblast cell lines, in which analysis of association with linked polymorphisms implies that cis-acting single nucleotide polymorphisms make only a modest contribution to bimodal distributions of transcript abundance. In this report we document the existence of TACs in a large sample of two North American populations of Drosophila melanogaster, as well as in previously published data on gene expression in lymphoblast cell lines from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) grandparents  (also see the CEPH website ). Transcriptional bimodality in CEPH lymphoblast cell lines To determine whether the relatively high frequency of less common minor TACs is unique to Drosophila, a similar analysis of transcript abundance in lymphoblast cell lines derived from 40 grandparents in the CEPH pedigrees  was performed.
At the same time, Epstein-Barr-transformed lymphoblast cell lines were established to avoid the repeated drawing of blood.

The first two measured proliferation and induction of IFN\u03b3 using human PBMC, whereas, the third measured induction of IFN\u03b3 from the human lymphoblast cell line NK-92 . Since the activity of human PBMC can vary from donor to donor, and the activation of NK cells may be important for anti-tumor activity, we developed a bioassay using the human lymphoblast cell line NK-92, which is an IL-2 dependent NK cell line that secretes newly synthesized IFN\u03b3 in response to IL-12 .
reported that B lymphoblast cell lines derived from male bipolar patients exhibit downregulation of IMPA2 expression accompanied by high free intracellular Ca+2 concentration.
In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of FD lymphoblast cell lines with kinetin increases IKBKAP mRNA and IKAP protein to normal levels. Where noted, lymphoblast cell lines were cultured with kinetin solution (Sigma 1\u00a0mg/ml), at a final concentration of 100\u00a0\u03bcM for 72\u00a0h unless otherwise stated. Reverse transcription was performed using 1\u00a0\u03bcg total RNA from kinetin-treated and untreated lymphoblast cell lines, oligo(dT) primer, and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). IKBKAP exon 20 splicing efficiency in FD lymphoblast cell lines Baseline IKBKAP levels were initially established using lymphoblast cell lines from three FD patients, three carriers, and three normal controls. The levels of WT IKBKAP in mRNA isolated from FD cell lines is approximately 30% of normal and that in carrier cell lines is 70% of normal, suggesting that the mutant allele is correctly spliced approximately 30% of the time in transformed lymphoblast cell lines. We found that in both the FD and carrier lymphoblast cell lines treated with kinetin for 3\u00a0days, the level of WT IKBKAP is increased above normal untreated levels, confirming that the observed change in isoform ratio leads to increased cellular levels of the WT IKBKAP transcript. RT-PCR was carried out using RNA extracted from three kinetin-treated and three untreated FD lymphoblast cell lines. FD lymphoblast cell lines were used specifically so that we could independently confirm kinetin activity by assaying IKBKAP exon 20 inclusion. Not surprisingly, the majority of genes did not express detectable levels of both isoforms in lymphoblast cell lines.

Transfection studies with expression vectors containing the l or s variants linked to a reporter gene indicated that the l variant directs higher levels of transcription compared to the s variant when expressed in lymphoblast cell lines, a human placental choriocarcinoma cell line (JAR) and in the raphe nucleus-derived cell line RN46. Analysis of SERT mRNA levels in 53 permanent lymphoblast cell lines with real-time PCR (using \u03b2-actin mRNA as a reference) failed to find a statistically significant correlation with SERTLPR, but did find evidence for a combined effect of SERTLPR and the intron 2 VNTR. Previous studies have investigated the influence of l and s SERTLPR alleles on SERT promoter activity in heterologous expression systems,SERT mRNA levels in lymphoblast cell lines and brain, SERT ligand binding and transport activity in platelets, and SERT ligand binding levels in post-mortem brain sections and living brain. Absolute levels of SERT mRNA were also measured in B-lymphoblast cell lines (14 l/l, 12 l/s and 8 s/s) by real-time PCR, a more advanced technique than the competitive PCR method used previously.
In addition, using a human T lymphoblast cell line a higher reporter luciferase activity for both the MIF \u2212173*C allele and the MIF \u2212173*C-CATT7 haplotype was found, although cell type-specific differences were also reported in this study.
The consecutive sampling approach was used to characterize the dispersion patterns of the gene expression data obtained from oligonucleotide probes for 632 genes on three groups of samples: 1) RNA samples from five parallel cultures of lymphoblast cell line GM10469 were reverse transcribed and each has a hybridization duplicate (Samples C1\u2013C5); 2) Pooled reference RNA sample has three reverse transcription/cRNA replicates (PR1, PR2, PR3, each with a duplicate hybridization); 3) Parallel cultures of lymphoblast cell line GM12831 were grown either untreated or in the presence of 1 mUnit/ml glucose oxidase (which generated a continuous dose of ~10 \u03bcmole H2O2).
The associated gene expression profile was partly tissue dependent, e.g., YES1 was overexpressed in the epithelial cell lines while it was not upregulated in a lymphoblast cell line.
Similarly, use 20\u201340 strokes (500 rpm) to homogenize 10\u201350 mg sedimented cells (e.g., mouse embryonic stems cells, human fibroblast and lymphoblast cell lines, 143B osteosarcoma and derived rho zero cell lines) in diluted sucrose buffer (83 mM sucrose, 6.6 mM imidazole/HCl, pH 7.0).

Total protein nuclear extracts of HeLa and lymphoblast cell lines (100 \u03bcg) as above were also resolved and probed with the above antibodies.
We decided to use QTL mapping data in mouse instead of human, because the only available human QTL mapping results are from lymphoblast cell lines, and it has been shown in mouse that QTLs in brain and hematopoietic stem cells differ greatly.
Table 1 shows that 13/18 (72.2%) cancer cell lines overexpressed hOGG1 mRNA, while 2/18 (11.1%) cancer cell lines demonstrated under-expression of hOGG1 mRNA relative to the normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE), normal retinal epithelial (ARPE-19) cells and NC-37, a lymphoblast cell line.
Transfection of the clone containing the C/7-CATT haplotype into a T-lymphoblast cell line resulted in significantly increased luciferase activity compared to that of G/5-CATT haplotype, supporting these findings.

Ratios of cDNA band intensity (GLDC/LPT) were calculated to be 0.95, 1.12, 0.14 and 0.08 in control 1, control 2, patient 1 and patient 2 lymphoblast cell lines, respectively, indicating that GLDC mRNA levels were markedly reduced in the tested patients\u2019 cell lines. This would render the protein product non-functional and may provide another explanation to the null GCS activity in the lymphoblast cell line and severe symptoms of the homozygous patients.
The minimum promoter of dCK has been characterized in lymphoblast cell lines.
The lowest ratios were observed in retinoblastoma cell line tissue (0.84\u00b10.21), while heart tissue (0.93\u00b10.01) and B lymphoblast cell lines (0.95\u00b10.12) showed intermediate values. For B lymphoblast cell lines, again no significant difference was found between (\u2212350)GG samples (C/T ratio 0.82\u00b10.08) and (\u2212350)AG samples (C/T ratio 1.02\u00b10.06; P>0.05; Figure 4b).

Chronic lithium treatment of B-lymphoblast cell lines (BLCLs) from bipolar-I disorder (BD-I) patients and healthy subjects ex vivo attenuates agonist- and thapsigargin-stimulated intracellular calcium (Ca2+) responses. Reports of elevated basal and agonist-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]B and [Ca2+]S, respectively) in mononuclear leukocytes, platelets and transformed B lymphoblast cell lines (BLCLs) from bipolar I disorder I (BD-I) patients therefore suggest that alterations of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis play an important role in the pathophysiological changes that are thought to compromise cellular resilience and adaptive response to cellular stress in BD.

The human B-cell lymphoma cell lines used in this study are: progenitor B-cell lines (Nalm-6, REH, HPB-Null, PBE-1), B-lymphoblast cell lines (WI-L2, TK-6, DW-10, DHL-16), Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (Raji, Ramos, OMA-BL-1, Namalwa). TK-6 is a lymphoblast cell line that is heterozygote for thymidine kinase. TK-6 is a derivative of the WI-L2, a lymphoblast cell line. Among the B-lymphoblast cell lines (WI-L2, TK-6, DW-10), only WI-L2 expressed annexin I, while its derivative TK-6 did not express annexin I.

Reduced inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) activity and elevated basal intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]B) have been reported in B lymphoblast cell lines (BLCLs) from bipolar I affective disorder (BD-I) patients, which may reflect cellular endophenotypes of this disorder. In this regard, recent observations of higher basal intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]B) in B-lymphoblast cell lines (BLCLs) derived from BD-I patients compared with healthy subjects may reflect a trait-dependent alteration in intracellular calcium homeostasis and a putative cellular \u2018endophenotype\u2019 of BD. B-lymphoblast cell lines (BLCLs) and postmortem brain

Studies of the 5-HTT in lymphoblast cell lines indicated that the presence of the LL 5-HTTLPR was associated with increased levels of 5-HTT mRNA and increased uptake of serotonin by the 5-HTT . As the density of [3H]paroxetine binding is a good measure of the density of 5-HTT, our data do not support the presence of a simple relationship between the genotype for 5-HTTLPR and levels of 5-HTT seen in the lymphoblast cell lines.

ABSTRACT: We used an in vitroT-lymphoblast clonal proliferation assay to quantify human IGF-I (hIGF-I)-, human PTH (hPTH)-, human ACTH (hACTH)-, and human TSH (hTSH)-stimulated growth of human T-cell leukemia virus-II-transformed T-lymphoblast cell lines from normal individuals and to elucidate the role of IGF-I as the mediator of hPTH-, hACTH-, and hTSH-induced T-cell growth. Normal T-lymphoblast cell lines respond to hIGF-I in a bimodal fashion. After stimulation with hPTH, the mean peak clonal response of normal T-lymphoblast cell lines was 189 \u00b1 7.0%; after incubation with \u03b1IR-3, the mean peak clonal response was 108 \u00b1 7.9% (p= 0.0015 between full response curves). The mean peak clonal response of normal T-lymphoblast cell lines after hACTH stimulation was 192 \u00b1 8.6%; preincubation with \u03b1IR-3 reduced the mean peak clonal response to 94 \u00b1 1.2% (p< 0.0001 between full response curves). With hTSH stimulation, the mean peak clonal response of normal T-lymphoblast cell lines was 167 \u00b1 7.0%; after incubation with \u03b1R-3, the mean peak clonal response was 94 \u00b1 8.2% (p= 0.003 between full response curves). After stimulation with hIGF-I, hPTH, hACTH, and hTSH, the mean peak clonal responses of a pygmy T-lymphoblast cell line were 112 \u00b1 8.2, 122 \u00b1 1.5. These data indicate that hPTH, hACTH, and hTSH stimulate growth of normal human T-lymphoblast cell lines through local action of IGF-I, because these effects can all be blocked by preincubation with MAb against the IGF-I receptor. The pygmy T-lymphoblast cell line showed little or no clonal expansion in the presence of hIGF-1 itself, or in response to hPTH, hACTH, or hTSH, further supporting the notion that an intact IGF-I response mechanism is necessary for the proliferative response to hPTH, hACTH, and hTSH in human T-lymphoblasts.

Investigation of lymphoblast cell lines from patients with KIF5A splice-site mutations revealed the loss of mutant RNA expression and suggested haploinsufficiency as the most probable underlying molecular mechanism. RNA was isolated from the immortalized lymphoblast cell lines derived from the mutation carriers and their unaffected mutation-negative relatives. RNA analysis in patient-derived lymphoblast cell lines Availability of immortalized lymphoblast cell lines from patients and controls allowed us to further delineate the functional effects of the above-described mutations at the mRNA level. KIF5A protein expression is tightly restricted to neurons preventing KIF5A protein analysis by western blotting; however, KIF5A mRNA was detectable in lymphoblast cell lines by PCR. Sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the presence of wild-type but failed to detect mis-spliced mRNA in lymphoblast cell lines from patients with the splice site variants c.2993-1G>A and c.3020+2T>C (Fig. 2A). To confirm a loss of expression of the splice site mutant alleles, we tried to quantify the total KIF5A mRNA levels in c.2993-1G>A and c.3020+2T>C splice site mutant and wild-type lymphoblast cell lines. In agreement with this prediction, sequencing of the PCR product from the respective lymphoblast cell line shows that this variant, separated only by one nucleotide from the 5\u2032 end of intron 27, disrupts the splice donor site of intron 27 (Fig. 2B). (Arg1007Gly)] missense mutation is detectable in the lymphoblast cell lines from the respective patient (data not shown). In our analysis of lymphoblast cell line RNA, the above-described SNV rs113247976 [p.

We propose that the principal reason for this is that the methodology used in the previous study, with tagged HDACs (as bait to pull down protein complexes) expressed in a T-lymphoblast cell line, may address a limited subset of potential partners.

HD patient-derived lymphoblast cell line carrying an HTT 73Q HD mutant allele (GM-04282) and one age-, passage number- and sex-matched control lymphoblast cell line (GM-03354) were obtained from Coriell Institute for Medical Research (New Jersey, USA). Because the sensitivity and specificity of the human HTT MSD assays were successfully demonstrated for human HTT transgenes in rodent brain tissues, we next focused on the detection of polyglutamine expanded and non-expanded HTT in a clinically relevant setting and analyzed human lymphoblast cell lines and post mortem cortex tissues obtained from HD and age-matched healthy control patients. Our human HTT bioassays allow an accurate detection of HTT in lysates obtained from human post mortem brain tissues as well as lymphoblast cell lines derived from both HD and non-HD control patients (Figure 6).
Most experiments involved the comparison of three lymphoblast cell lines from individuals with FRDA versus three cell lines from healthy subjects. An additional FRDA lymphoblast cell line, OK22 (400 and 860 repeats), was established in the laboratory. However, in NOMe-Seq and RNA-Seq assays, we compared two FRDA versus two non-FRDA lymphoblast cell lines; in these assays, FRDA-1 and FRDA-2 refer to GM15850 and OK22, and CNTR-1 and CNTR-2 refer to GM22647 and GM22671, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from two non-FRDA (GM22647 and GM22671) and two FRDA (GM15850 and OK22) lymphoblast cell lines. Chromatin accessibility at FXN-TSS2 was measured in three FRDA and three non-FRDA lymphoblast cell lines.

The Human T lymphoblast cell line SUP-T1 (ATCC CRL-1942) was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
To determine whether the drug-mediated repression of the AKT pathway was restricted to the J45.01 T-lymphoblast cell line, we exposed the OCI-LY10 B-cell lymphoma line to similar drug combinations and analyzed the changes in the level of expression and modification of the above-mentioned proteins. Together with the activation of the SAPK/JNK stress signaling pathway, the inhibition of the AKT pathway may partly explain the synergistic cytotoxicity of [Gem+Clo+Ed] toward the J45.01 T-lymphoblast cell line.
In a lymphoblast cell line, s/s genotype at promoter polymorphic site of SERT gene was associated with lower transcriptional efficiency, resulting in lower SERT expression and therefore lower cellular uptake of 5-HT .
A panel of four cancer cell lines of different tissues of origins, namely: human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (A549), human lymphoblast cell line (CEM), human cervix cell line (HeLa) and human breast epithelial cell line (MCF-7) were studied.
The mice exhibit signs of disease (also common in other lymphoblast cell line transplant models) by approximately 3 weeks post-engraftment, and all 10 animals were sacrificed (due to significant hind limb paralysis) between 21-25 days post-engraftment (Figure 5A).
Additionally, in both BJAB and IB4 cells (B-lymphoblast cell line with high NF-\u03baB and miR-155 expression relative to BJAB cells ), treatment with LPS for 24\u00a0h resulted in 5-fold and 2.8-fold increases in mature miR-155 levels, respectively (Figure\u00a01C). One study  claimed that a conserved AP-1 site 40 nt upstream of the MIR155HG TSS is required for high level miR-155 expression in EBV+ B-lymphoblast cell line JY.

The human lymphoblast cell line TK6 was kindly provided by Dr Howard Liber, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.
In support of this hypothesis, Sanger sequencing of multiple cDNA extractions derived from a transformed lymphoblast cell line from subject 2 showed that both alleles were expressed (see Additional file 6, Figure S4) although this does not exclude that some degree of NMD may occur or reflect what occurred during development.
AZT enhances NF-\u03baB activation in a promyeloide leukemia cell line, the monocyte-like U937 cell line, and the T lymphoblast cell line MOLT .
As shown in Figure 2A, the expression of SETD4 was elevated in the HCC-1954, SKBR-3, MDA-MB 231 and MDA-MB 436 cell lines compared with the control HCC-1954-BL cell line, a lymphoblast cell line isolated from the same individual from who the HCC-1954 breast cancer cells were isolated (p<0.001).
Subsequent sequencing of patient peripheral blood DNA, lymphoblast cell lines, and laser capture microdissection of various cellular compartments of the prostate all revealed similar levels of heteroplasmic mutation at this base, confirming inheritance in the germ line and maintenance of the mutation in the prostate. Cytochrome oxidation was measured in mitochondria isolated from the patient's lymphoblast cell line and compared to other lymphoblast cell lines from two unrelated, individuals' lymphoblast lines, sequence proven to be wild type at the COI locus (Figure 1(b)). In order to determine if this was occurring, we assayed the lymphoblast cell line of the patient for increased peroxide levels using dichlorofluorescin (DCF) and compared the results to the two-wild type patients described above. There was a marked increase (1.75 fold) in DCF fluorescence in the lymphoblast cell line containing the mutation compared to wildtype (Figure 1(c), gray bars). This is made possible by the combination of capturing clinically relevant mutations in patient lymphoblast cell lines and the subsequent formation of cybrids with a common nuclear background.
The Raji cell line, a human B lymphoblast cell line, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, CCL-86). In this manuscript, we describe the events that occurred during the internalisation of three different bacteria into a B lymphoblast cell line (Raji cell line).
Unlike reports from macrophages, HIV-1 infection in MOLT-4 T lymphoblast cell line and CD4+ T cells has been suggested by one research group to inhibit autophagy as measured by reduced LC3-II or Beclin-1 levels  (Figure 3B); this indicates that in T-cells the process of autophagy may be a net negative for HIV-1 replication .
Previously, mutant RP1 mRNA was found to be present in a human lymphoblast cell line carrying the p.R677* variant, providing evidence that this mRNA indeed escapes the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay process.
Moreover, young TILs could recognize autologous EBV-transformed B lymphoblast cell lines, but not autologous EBV-negative blast cells or allogeneic EBV-negative tumor cells. However, the generation of EBV-CTLs or EBV peptide-specific CTLs from peripheral blood is a complex, time-consuming, and laborious process, which includes setting up EBV-positive transformed B lymphoblast cell lines (LCLs), limited dilution cloning, culture establishment by in vitro restimulations, and genetic engineering.
chIL2/15R\u03b2 transcripts were detected in the lymphoblast cell line CU205 and in normal lymphoid organs and at moderate levels in bursa samples. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was used to examine the expression of chIL2/15R\u03b2 transcripts in various normal tissues and two chicken cell lines, the REV-transformed lymphoblast cell line CU205 and the macrophage cell line HD11 (Fig. 3A). Chicken lymphoblast cell line CU205 , macrophage cell line HD11 , and splenic lymphocytes were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) (Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 unit/ml) (Hyclone) at 41\u00b0C in 5% CO2.
In parallel with the in utero exposure study, in vitro studies using a human lymphoblast cell line exposed to arsenic were also carried out. A lymphoblast cell line (RPMI1788), established from human peripheral blood lymphocytes (profile# TKG0464), was obtained from the ATCC (#CCL-156). The level of total 5-MedC content in the treated lymphoblast cell line was not significantly different from the untreated levels except at six weeks of treatment, which significantly reduced (p < 0.01) at six weeks of treatment, both at 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM. Two weeks of treatment with arsenite showed no effect on p53 promoter methylation in the lymphoblast cell line, but a dramatic increase (approximately 300 % of the control level) was observed at four weeks (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 at arsenite concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM, respectively), with a subsequent decrease to control levels by six weeks. To achieve a better understanding of the epigenetic effects of arsenic exposure, DNA methylation was further investigated in vitro, through short-term and long-term exposure using a human lymphoblast cell line.
The effect of the mutation on cDNA was studied in RNA from the lymphoblast cell line and from cultured skin fibroblasts of patient II-4.
However, previous study demonstrates that C/EBP\u03b3 augments the C/EBP\u03b2 stimulatory activity in lipopolysaccharide induction of IL-6 promoter in a B lymphoblast cell line. Previous study shows that C/EBP\u03b3 dramatically augments the activity of C/EBP\u03b2 in LPS induction of the IL-6 and IL-8 promoters in a B lymphoblast cell line . Furthermore, the stable expression of C/EBP\u03b2 in a murine B lymphoblast cell line is sufficient to confer LPS inducibility of IL-6 expression .
In a recent article, ASE patterns in a human lymphoblast cell line were analyzed using RNA-Seq .
In this study, Vpr that is introduced, via transient transfection or lentivirus infection, into the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, human CD4+ T lymphoblast cell line SupT1, or human primary CD4+ T cells serves as the model system to study the molecular mechanism of Vpr-mediated HIV-1 pathogenesis. Considering that CD4+ T cells are the primary target of HIV-1, we further examined the influence of Vpr on Sup T1, a human CD4+ T lymphoblast cell line. Human CD4+ T lymphoblast cell line SupT1 was obtained from ATCC and grown in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin.

Studies using reporter gene assays revealed that the S variant reduced transcriptional efficiencies of the SLC6A4 in a human placental choriocarcinoma cell line (JAR) , lymphoblast cell lines  and in the raphe nucleus-derived cell line (RN46A) . This effect was evaluated in lymphoblast cell line, and this may not necessary be true in other models.

Histone modifications were analyzed in three ICF (ICF3, ICF4, and ICF5) and three control (N9, N10, and N11) lymphoblast cell lines. H3K27 monomethylation is increased in ICF lymphoblast cell lines This study was performed on DNA and RNA extracted from human lymphoblast cell lines and peripheral blood in the context of routine molecular diagnostic service. Three lymphoblast cell lines (ICF5, N10 and N11) were purchased at the Coriell Cell Repositories. The lymphoblast cell line ICF4 was established at the Genethon laboratory (Evry, France). DNA and RNA were extracted from lymphoblast cell lines and from peripheral blood. Three hundred ng of genomic DNA (extracted from peripheral blood when available, otherwise from lymphoblast cell lines) were treated with bisulphite and then purified using the Microcon YM-100 filter device (Millipore) to separate DNA from bisulphite. \nStandard PCR-Two \u00b5g of total RNA (extracted from peripheral blood when available, otherwise from lymphoblast cell lines) were reverse transcribed using the Omniscript kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer protocol.
Expression was initially assessed in two female and one male diploid telomerase immortalized cell lines (hTERT), two diploid female primary fibroblast cultures and one EBV transformed diploid female lymphoblast cell line. In the lymphoblast cell line GM06999, DXZ4 was primarily detected from the Xa (84% of nuclei, n\u200a=\u200a50) with only 6% of nuclei showing DXZ4 at the Xi only and 2% showing DXZ4 from both the Xi and Xa. Next we sought to investigate the expression of DXZ4 from the Xi and Xa in 10 different female lymphoblast cell lines by RNA FISH with direct labeled probes; five from CEPH family 1331 and five from family 1345.
Tr1-cell lines efficiently lysed U937 cells, a monocytic cell line, but not K562 cells, an erythroleukemic cell line (Fig. 2A), or Daudi, a B lymphoblast cell line, or Jurkat, a T leukemic cell line (Supporting Information Fig. 2).
However, Gimelbrant et al.  assessed 3,939 genes in multiple clonal lymphoblast cell lines (LCLs) and found that roughly 10% were monoallelically expressed and observed a large diversity in RME genes. Validated imprinting in lymphoblast cell lines and fibroblasts Two lymphoblast cell lines (19099 and 19141) were treated with three concentrations (1, 5 and 10 \u03bcM) of the demethylating drug AZA every 24 hours for 3 days. AE: allelic expression; AZA: 5-azadeoxycytidine; IBD: identical-by-descent; LCL, lymphoblast cell line; RME: random monoallelic expression; SD: standard deviation; SNP: single-nucleotide polymorphism.
Cell culture and reagents: The lymphoblast cell line DS-1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-11102; Manassas, USA), and were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete culture medium (Gibco, New York, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 10 mM HEPES buffer (Gibco), 10 U/ml human IL-6 (Sigma, USA), penicillin (16 mg/l) and streptomycin (25 mg/l) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 .

To extend our results to the human genomic context, we analyzed patient-derived lymphoblast cell lines. Two of the pre-mutation lymphoblast cell lines (#C0051.004, (CGG)90, and #C014.004, (CGG)91, a kind gift from Stephanie Sherman) were derived from patients with clinically probable FXTAS. Although analysis of EBV-transformed lymphoblast cell lines has been a mainstay of research related to chromatin changes associated with Fragile X spectrum disorders, evidence suggests that epigenetic changes in these cell lines do not always reflect the chromatin state in the starting tissues . For drug studies in lymphoblast cell lines, these were done as a paired T-Test. There is enrichment of the FMR1 exon 1 locus in pre-mutation carrier lymphoblast cell lines when ChIP is performed against either Ac-histone H3K9 or Ac-histone H4 compared to IgG alone. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results from each lymphoblast cell line. We therefore assessed the effects on viability and cytotoxicity of various doses of HAT inhibitors on lymphoblast cell lines. B) However, at higher doses (20\u201350 \u00b5M garcinol) and with longer exposures (48\u201396 hrs), these drugs were toxic to lymphoblast cell lines.
The analysis was conducted on the breast cancer cell line HCC1954, and a lymphoblast cell line from the same individual, HCC1954BL.

To identify gene expression changes and pathways induced by IFN-\u03b2 in B cells, we studied the in vitro response of human Epstein Barr-transformed B cells (lymphoblast cell lines-LCLs), and validated our results in primary B cells. However, human B cells can be transformed by the EBV to create lymphoblast cell lines (LCLs) that retain many B cell properties, including typical cell surface markers and immunoglobulin secretion , as well as phenotypic characteristics of the donor B cells .
Although gene expression analyses of ASD brain are just beginning to emerge, several studies have evaluated gene expression in readily available peripheral tissues (blood and lymphoblast cell lines) from ASD patients (Hu et al., ; Gregg et al., ; Enstrom et al., .
Supernatant-containing virus was used to infect human lymphoblast cell lines SUP-T1 (CRL-1942, ATCC) and HuT78 (TIB-161, ATCC) and selected for puromycin resistance and TCR expression with PM-loaded CD1c tetramers.
Human B-lymphoblast cell lines (B-LCL) were produced by\ntransformation of human PBMC with human Epstein Barr virus (EBV) B95-8 cell\nsupernatant kindly provided by Dr. W. Sugden.
T cells of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) do not control the rate of B lymphoblast transformation induced by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as efficiently as T cells from healthy individuals; thus, lymphoblast cell lines are established more readily in RA lymphocytes in vitro after EBV infection.
